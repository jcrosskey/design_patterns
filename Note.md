## OO Basics

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance

## OO principles
* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interfaces, not implementations
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
    - Applying the open-closed principle EVERYWHERE is wasteful and unnecessary, and can lead to complex, hard-to-understand code.
