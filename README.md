# design_patterns

This is a repository with python implementation of design patterns from [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do), which uses java mainly.

There are also some sample implementations of patterns from [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=T5MT0MSKYV58JHR0R6P8). This is the classic book on design patterns and includes more patterns than the first book.

Some excerpt from these books is cited in the docstring.

* Different algorithms can be swapped at run time (dynamically) as well.
* Questions
  - Why is called "strategy pattern"?
  - Examples where this pattern can/should be used?
